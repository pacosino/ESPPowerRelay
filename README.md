# DIY - Smart Home Power Relay
There exists many Relay Modules for IOT, but I could not find a Module that fits in a 60mm European Wallbox and is independent of Protocols or Wireless standards. That’s why my Do-It-Yourself Smart Home Power Relay is born…
Caution: These modules do not have any certifications… In most countries it’s not legal to use it in Production. And: 230V AC can kill ! 

The main goals for this Project are:
 -	As **small** as possible
 -	As **cheap** as possible
 -	As **save** as possible
 -	As **flexible** as possible

Specially the flexibility is something important for me, as I have different scenarios to fulfill and I want to be able to change the Wireless technology if it’s required. This is the reason why the Result is not a single Module, there are currently 3 Modules: Power, Relay and Wireless (currently based on a ESP8266-12)

With a **size** of 45mm * 35mm * 20mm (Length, Width, Height), the module is small enough to mount it in wall (e.g. behind a power switch).

If you build 10pieces, the price for the material is around **14$ (for all three modules)**.
